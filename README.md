# M1 Interview Prep - Project Log

## Warmup Project 

### Project Overview

#### List out the tools you used:
1. VS code 
2. Classes  
3. Methods 
...

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:
It give us a card number, and we nned to write some code to see if the card number is invalid, with the steps on iteration 1.
### Reflection Questions: 
1. How do you approach solving something when you don’t have all the information?**<br />
- I always try to look at the sources I have and, if I still don't understand I try searching it up on google.
2. What was your most effective strategy for getting through blockers during this project? How did this help your process?**<br />

3. Tell us about a time that you found yourself in an unproductive struggle, how did you get out of it?**<br />
- Take a break of 5 minutes, or if I'm struggling with something I try other sources.
4. What was the benefit of using TDD while building out this project?**<br />

## First Solo

2.
3.
...

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:

### Reflection Questions: 
**1. Pick 1 technical concept you used for this project (look back at our lessons and the learning goals of the project to pick this). Explain what this concept is, how it works, and give an example of where you used this in your code.**<br />
**2. What was your process when you got stuck?**<br />
**3. If you had to do this project again, what would you do differently and why?**<br />

## Second Solo

### Project Overview

#### List out the tools you used:
1. Branches
2. TDD
3. Helper methods
...

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:
It take information from different states, and we have to create classes and TDD with the information given from each states.

### Reflection Questions: 
**1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.**<br />
Doing TDD and creating helper methods.
**2. What was the benefit of using TDD while building out this project?**<br />
It can take me into the right path of constructing my class and what methods do I need to in the class.
**3. What was a resource that you used during this project and how did you use this to move your project forward?**<br />
One of the resource it could be helper methods, and it help me to make my code more clean and not so long.

### Reflection Questions
**1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
- First: I run each of the spec files and I was reading each of the erros; second: I went to each of the class methods and try to fix the error.
**2 What was hard about working with code you did not write?
- I was just wondering where it was going to fail each test.
**3 What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
- I would say trying to understand were the error is and fixing it.

## Paired Paired

We got to work most of the game working.

### Reflection Questions: 
**1. What was your pairing style like? How did you manage your Github work flow? What are your thoughts on that workflow?**<br />
The pairing style was pretty good with my partner. The Github work flow was correctly and evenly for the both of us.
**2. What skill do you feel you have a better handle on after working on this project? What skill has this project lead you to realize you need more practice on?**<br />
I would say the TDD part. The diving work with the partner
**3. What strategies help you best work with others? What would you like others to know about how you work best?**<br />
The communication.
## Group Project

### Project Overview

#### List out the tools you used:
1. TDD
2. GitHub projects
3. organization with the whole project
...

#### Write a 1-2 sentence synopsis of what this project does:

### Reflection Questions: 
**1. Group: What conflicts came up and how did you resolve them?  This could look like different opinions on how to code a method, what to name a class, when to do stand ups, or communication breakdowns.**<br />
The merged conflicts what we were having.
**2. Pick 1 technical concept you used for this project (look back at our lessons and the learning goals of the project to pick this). Explain what this concept is, how it works, and give an example of where you used this in your code.**<br />
The organization that we had with the methods and the way we use helper methods on your code.
**3. Describe your team’s code review process. How did you ensure your end product worked and was of high quality?**<br />
We got all of the test at 100% coverage and passing.
